This is an experimental fork to tweak coffee-script commonjs modules to work
on jetpack-sdk.

To test jetpack-sdk + coffe-script you can:

     cd YOUR_JETPACK_SDK
     source bin/activate
     cd ..
     git clone http://github.com/rpl/coffee-script.git coffee-script
     cd coffee-script/examples/coffee-on-jetpack
     cfx run -a xulrunner -b /your/path/firefox

An interesting feature of this example is the coffee-loader module 
(examples/coffee-on-jetpack/lib/coffee-loader.js)
